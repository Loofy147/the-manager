# Technical Debt Log

This document logs known limitations and areas for future improvement.

| ID | Title | Description | Priority | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TD-01 | Add Performance Benchmarks | The application currently lacks performance benchmarks. Adding benchmarks for key algorithms and API endpoints will help to identify and prevent performance regressions. | Medium | Tech Lead |
| TD-02 | Implement Monitoring Dashboards | The application currently lacks monitoring dashboards. Creating dashboards for key metrics (latency, errors, throughput, cost) will help to improve observability and reduce the time to detect and resolve production issues. | High | Tech Lead |
| TD-03 | Add End-to-End Tests | The application currently lacks end-to-end tests. Adding end-to-end tests for critical user flows will help to ensure that the application is working as expected in a production-like environment. | High | Tech Lead |
| TD-04 | Improve Test Coverage | The current test suite provides a good baseline, but it could be improved by adding more unit and integration tests for both the backend and frontend. | Medium | Tech Lead |
